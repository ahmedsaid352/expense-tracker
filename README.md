# Expense Tracker API

This is an **Expense Tracker** application built with **ASP.NET Core Web API**. The project follows a clean architecture by implementing the **Repository Pattern** for database operations and a **Service Layer** for business logic. The API supports **JWT-based Authentication** and implements **DTOs** for data transfer between the client and server.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure API access.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete expenses.
- **Expense Filtering**: Filter expenses based on date (start date and end date).
- **Repository Pattern**: For decoupling data access logic.
- **Service Layer**: To encapsulate business logic.


## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core** for database operations
- **SQL Server** for the database
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Repository Pattern** and **Service Layer** for clean architecture
